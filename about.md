**What is this competency matrix about?**

This map is intended to be a starting point to guide you through your learning, and help you build your own over the years.
If you ask three different engineers, what makes a full stack javascript web developer, you will get four different answers. This competency matrix is intended to be a partial survey of the territory of web development. Ultimately, every engineer builds their own map, and ideally becomes an authority themselves on the topic.

**How should I use this map?**

1. Use the skill groups to learn about the different dimensions of knowledge/application you need to learn, and the ground that needs to be covered.
2. Use the skill sets to assess your knowledge, and discover gaps in it that need to be filled.
3. Use the priorities to help you answer the question: What should I work on next? For example: don't work on a Priority 3 skills, if there are multiple Priority 1 skills that you still haven't acquired/developed.
4. Use the resource lists to find curated resources relevant to the skills

**What are the priorities?**

The priorities are meant to help you prioritize your learning in order to be job ready:
- Roughly speaking, it will be very difficult for you to get a job as a software developer if you're missing Priority 1 skills.
- If you have the majority of Priority 1 and Priority 2 skills down, you have an OK chance of getting a job. It will take some time, some luck, and a winning personality!
- If you have the majority of Priority 3 skills down we're fairly confident that you will be able to land a job.
- If you have the majority of Priority 4 skills then you'll probably be fielding multiple job offers. Nice work!
- If you're a Pri 5 engineer, you should call us, we're hiring!
- If you're a Pri 6, well, we would like to work for you, let us know when you're hiring. 

**How should I not use this map?**

- Don't try and check off every single skill, and every single skill group. Remember, programming is about what you can figure out, not just what you know.
- Don't use it to overwhelm yourself. Millions of people have developed these skills, and many of them are attainable in parallel. You'll get there!
